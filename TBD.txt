4. iptables update
5. DB login should have usr and passwd ... not using any as of now
6. use of virtual env during deployment
7. https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html?highlight=stats#profile.Profile.create_stats
8. Create a new mail id - otp@readdress.io to get TOTP
9. Create a REST API that takes API key, phone number and totp and returns user data
10. update verify page with details on why plus code is asked
11. include API key in welcome mail based on domain
12. use supervisorctl status to get list of processes and send sigusr1 to all pids -- is this required ?

There is a way we can use this service for password less login into other services - location based login
During signup, the user is asked to share location and give a name for the same (eg. home), we save a token in
the machine indentifing the user and location

Later similar to google signin, other websites can add support for our login and if clicked, we check for saved token
and its validity, if not we mail him a link to establish identity on that machine based on location. Since the accuracy
of location on desktop / laptops are less, we can provide qr-code that can be scanned on mobile to open the same link
with some extra info so that server knows the identity and accurate location everytime.

This system can replace the rest api and otp based approach above.

Another idea is to provide random user id oursleves instead of phone number. For that to work, we need to generate messsge id ourselves
and maintain db of the same. This is useful for people who want to hide their phone number. The other approach is similar to url
shortener, we generate a random id based on hmac of the actual email id and send this in the signup response. So phone number is still
present with us but mapped email id doesn't have it.


Non critical
* Should we handle cases where email-id is modified and difft users are to be notfied abt the same

2. Send deregister cancel link for deregister/unsunsbcribe mailid
